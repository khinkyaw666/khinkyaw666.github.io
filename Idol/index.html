    <h2>Earily Life and Education</h2>

        Leonardo DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles to George and Irmelin DiCaprio. He grew up in a creative and bohemian environment, with his parents divorcing when he was young. DiCaprio’s acting career began at a young age, with his first notable role in the TV series Parenthood in 1990. He attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies and later Le Lycée Français de New York, a bilingual school where he became fluent in French.

His early roles in television and movies set him on the path to becoming one of Hollywood's most famous actors.
